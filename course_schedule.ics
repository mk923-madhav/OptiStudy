DESCRIPTION:This is a team assignment.  Only 1 (one) assignment should be
  turned in per team. \n\nRecall that Crit sessions are times where studen
 ts engage with external practitioners throughout the course. These practit
 ioners are active\, product owners\, technical managers\, founders\, and e
 ntrepreneurs in NYC who join us on select evenings during the semester to 
 provide practical feedback and instruction\, encourage progress\, and help
  address any blockers or risks the students are facing. Crit is not only a
 n opportunity for your to received guidance and feedback on your venture i
 dea and progress but also an opportunity for your to network. \n\nInstruc
 tions\n\n1. Assign at least one person to record the feedback received dur
 ing Crit. \n2. Write a 1 pager (max)\, identifying the feedback you've re
 ceived. Discuss explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the feedback
 . This means the document should clearly document the feedback given\, how
  you interpreted the feedback\, whether you agree or disagree with the fee
 dback\, and your reasons for the same. You may also discuss what you plan 
 to do with the feedback.\n3. Submit as a PDF.\n\nIllustrative Example: \n
 * Feedback: The practitioner stated that two other startups have tried a v
 ery similar idea\, but failed in execution. \n* Interpretation: The pract
 itioner is concerned that we can't execute the idea because it is technica
 lly difficult.\n* Agree/Disagree: Disagree\, because we interviewed three 
 subject matter experts during our stakeholder research and showed new prom
 ising technology where this is now possible. \n* Plan for feedback: The p
 ractitioner identified an execution risk and we intend to explore this ris
 k further.\n\nPro Tips: \n\n1. Not all practitioners will be in the indus
 try that you are working in. You need to present and talk about what you'r
 e doing in layman’s terms that are easy to understand. This is what this
  assignment is teaching you. Do not spend the full 5 minutes walking a pra
 ctitioner through the entire process. \n2. You may receive conflicting fe
 edback from different practitioners. That’s ok - it’s actually part of
  the process. That's why the focus is how you decide what to do with the f
 eedback. Remember that each piece of feedback is a single data point\, not
  gospel\, so you may occasionally choose to disregard feedback that you re
 ceive in Crit. Learning how to filter feedback is crucial to product devel
 opment and entrepreneurship. It’s only when you notice trends in feedbac
 k that ignoring them becomes an issue. Remember to Connect the Dots.

DESCRIPTION:Hi\,\n\nAs I mentioned in class\, I would like you to reflect 
 on your class participation in this course this semester and provide me wi
 th a self-assessment of your participation.\n\nI count on your interest to
  participate in class discussions throughout the course. In-class particip
 ation includes as asking questions\, replying to issues raised by others\,
  advancing class discussions\, offering new ideas\, and demonstrating cour
 se concepts with personal experiences.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to 
 participate in on-line discussions. The course site on Canvas includes a 
 “Discussions” area which is available for a variety of purposes\, such
  as:\n\n•    Posting questions for me and/or your classmates\,\n•  
   Posting responses and comments to the questions posed by classmates\,\n
 •    Posting the URL of any Web-based accounting resource that you fou
 nd interesting or helpful\,\n\nFor your reference\, I believe a grade of 8
 /10 for participation demonstrates that a student met all expectations. In
  order to earn a grade greater than 8/10 a student must exceed expectation
 s. While there is no formula or single pathway to exceed expectations\, a 
 general theme to this end is to make a significant contribution to the lea
 rning of other students.\n\nWith this in mind\, I have created an assignme
 nt with zero weight on the course Canvas site. It is called “Participati
 on Self-Assessment.” This is an essay question format. Please give yours
 elf a grade out of 10. Also\, I’d appreciate it if you could add a few l
 ines to explain why you feel you earned this grade.\n\nThe deadline to com
 plete this short process is 11:59pm on March 21. This is a requirement\, a
 nd I will not release my assessment of your class participation until you 
 complete this.\n\nThanks for your cooperation. Please let me know if you h

DESCRIPTION:* Watch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game for
  crypto history.\n\n* Watch the movie: Banking on Bitcoin http://www.imd
 b.com/title/tt5033790/\n\n \n\nAnswer the following questions and submit 
 the answers with your final deliverable:\n\nHW1:\n\n1) give an informal de
 finition of a private-key encryption scheme.\n\n2) Consider a sample encry
 ption scheme where the key is a random 4-digit pin code denoted by: d1\, d
 2\, d3\, d4. To encrypt a message m\, first break the message up into chun
 ks of four letters. Next\, shift each four-letter block of your message by
  your pin code. For instance\, if the key (i.e.\, the pin code) is 3412\, 
 the message GOODMORNING gets encrypted as follows:\n\n \n\n       
      G O O D      M O R  N       I   N  G\n\n      
       3  4  1  2        3  4  1  2        3 
  4   1\n\n            J   S  P  F        P  S  
  S  P       L  R  H\n\nThe following tool allows you to play aroun
 d with this "PIN-encryption" scheme: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hahbv9v6z3
 istug/PIN-encrypt.xlsx?dl=0\n\n* a) Encrypt the message ILOVECORNELLTECH u
 sing the PIN 7942\; b) explain how to decrypt messages\; c) is this encr
 yption scheme secure? (motivate your answer!)\n\n3) given an informal defi
 nition of a public-key encryption scheme.\n\n4) give an informal definitio
 n of a digital signature scheme.\n\n4) describe the difference between a p
 ublic-key and a secret-key in a digital signature scheme\n\n5) describe ho
 w we can use a "trusted ledger" (e.g. a trusted facebook wall) in combinat
 ion with digital signatures to create a crypto currency. Explain how digit
 al signatures protect money from being stolen. Discuss some pro's and con'
 s w.r.t. standard banking.  \n\nHW2:\n\n1) Explain the difference between
  a proof-of-work blockchain\, a proof-of-stake blockchain\, and a permissi
 oned blockchain. Discuss some advantages and disadvantages w.r.t. each of 
 them.\n\n2) Give one example of a situation where you would prefer to use 
 a permissioned blockchain\, and one where you would prefer to use a permis
 sionless (i.e.\, a proof-of-work or proof-or-stake based one).\n\n3) Mine 
 10 ``blocks'' in excel:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lvmqog3m0wmioq8/minin
 g-in-excel.xlsx?dl=0\n\n4) Informally describe the liveness and consistenc
 y properties that a blockchain should satisfy.\n\n5) Consider a candidate 
 blockchain protocol—let’s call it CornellChain—where a list of trans
 actions is replicated among 100 different servers. If someone wanted to ad
 d a transaction to this blockchain\, they would simply send it to one (or 
 more) of the servers together with the time that the transaction was made.
  Any server that receives a new transaction also sends it to all other ser
 vers. Transactions on this blockchain are ordered on each server according
  to the time when they were made.\n\n \n\nDoes CornellChain satisfy liven
 ess and/or consistency under some assumptions on the fraction of correct s
 ervers. Can you think of a scenario under which consistency can be broken?
  Are there situations where CornellChain can still function as a valid “
 blockchain”?\n\n \n\nProject Deliverable\n\nPick some recent cryptocurr
 ency/ICO or blockchain application\; write an approx 5-7 page report (in t
 ext\, not powerpoint) analyzing it. Think of the intended audience of the 
 report as a VC who is considering investing in the currency. Explain advan
 tages/disadvantages of the cryptocurrency w.r.t. e.g.\, Bitcoin. Explain w
 hether the blockchain employed is permissioned or permissionless (and in t
 his case\, whether it relies on proof of work or proof of stake). Does it 
 support smart contracts? Does the currency have any special new applicatio
 ns or use cases? \n\nOther final projects options are also available such
  as e.g.\,\n\n* developing a financial model for evaluating worth of a cry
 ptocurrency.\n\n* studying some blockchain application from a societal poi
 nt of view. \n\nYour groups should also prepare a 15 min presentation to 
 be jointly presented in class. \n\n--------------------------------------
 ---------------------------\n\nPlease submit the whole final deliverable i
 n one pdf which includes a) the answer to all HW problems\, and b) the fin
 al report + slides for your presentaion. You should only submit 1 pdf fil
 e per group of 4-5 people\, and clearly mark all the participants of the g
 roup. The final deliverable is due on March 21st.

DESCRIPTION:Starting with your in-class draft as a starting point\, spend 
 some time refining your North Star Metric. Think carefully about what your
  "game" is (Attention\, Transaction\, Productivity) or\, if your Job To Be
  Done is well-defined\, how you might link your NSM to your JTBD. (If that
  doesn't feel right\, it's a sign that your JTBD needs work!)\n\nThen\, us
 ing the dimensions discussed in class (breadth\, depth\, frequency\, effic
 iency)\, identify three "input metrics" that would\, when combined\, lead 
 to meaningful improvements in your overall NSM.\n\nIn your team's submissi
 on\, include:\n\n* Your team name\n\n* Your product narrative (theory of c
 hange\, elevator pitch\, job to be done\, etc.)\n\n* Your North Star Metri
 c\n\n* Your three input metrics\n\nBelow are reference readings about Nort
 h Star Metrics that can help you in this exercise:\n\n* [North Star Playbo
 ok] (https://amplitude.com/north-star)\n\n* [LinkedIn case study] (http://
