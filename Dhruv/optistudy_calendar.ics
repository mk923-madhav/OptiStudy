 ncluded) \n\n* Defined user profile\, using the table in the slides\n\n* 
 Include all categories from the brainstorm phase\, minimum of 6. Make sure
  you are including clear category buckets (e.g. if you are doing Geo\, is

DESCRIPTION:This is a team assignment.  Only 1 (one) assignment should be
  turned in per team. \n\nRecall that Crit sessions are times where studen
 ts engage with external practitioners throughout the course. These practit
 ioners are active\, product owners\, technical managers\, founders\, and e
 ntrepreneurs in NYC who join us on select evenings during the semester to 
 provide practical feedback and instruction\, encourage progress\, and help
  address any blockers or risks the students are facing. Crit is not only a
 n opportunity for your to received guidance and feedback on your venture i
 dea and progress but also an opportunity for your to network. \n\nInstruc
 tions\n\n1. Assign at least one person to record the feedback received dur
 ing Crit. \n2. Write a 1 pager (max)\, identifying the feedback you've re
 ceived. Discuss explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the feedback
 . This means the document should clearly document the feedback given\, how
  you interpreted the feedback\, whether you agree or disagree with the fee
 dback\, and your reasons for the same. You may also discuss what you plan 
 to do with the feedback.\n3. Submit as a PDF.\n\nIllustrative Example: \n
 * Feedback: The practitioner stated that two other startups have tried a v
 ery similar idea\, but failed in execution. \n* Interpretation: The pract
 itioner is concerned that we can't execute the idea because it is technica
 lly difficult.\n* Agree/Disagree: Disagree\, because we interviewed three 
 subject matter experts during our stakeholder research and showed new prom
 ising technology where this is now possible. \n* Plan for feedback: The p
 ractitioner identified an execution risk and we intend to explore this ris
 k further.\n\nPro Tips: \n\n1. Not all practitioners will be in the indus
 try that you are working in. You need to present and talk about what you'r
 e doing in layman’s terms that are easy to understand. This is what this
  assignment is teaching you. Do not spend the full 5 minutes walking a pra
 ctitioner through the entire process. \n2. You may receive conflicting fe
 edback from different practitioners. That’s ok - it’s actually part of
  the process. That's why the focus is how you decide what to do with the f
 eedback. Remember that each piece of feedback is a single data point\, not
  gospel\, so you may occasionally choose to disregard feedback that you re
 ceive in Crit. Learning how to filter feedback is crucial to product devel
 opment and entrepreneurship. It’s only when you notice trends in feedbac
 k that ignoring them becomes an issue. Remember to Connect the Dots.
