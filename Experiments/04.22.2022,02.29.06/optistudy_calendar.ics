DESCRIPTION:--------\nScenario\n--------\n\nYou built a Minimum Viable Pro
 duct for a virtual assistant\, which helps working professionals better ma
 nage their calendar by providing recommendations about work\, social\, and
  family activities. You launched it and your user base is growing. After s
 eeing initial results\, you developed a few hypotheses and prioritized fea
 tures on the roadmap accordingly.\n\n \n\nBelow is a summary of your 3 ke
 y hypotheses\, the actions you took based on your hypotheses\, and the res
 ults.\n\n \n\nHypothesis 1\n\n* Context: 1% of users who visit your websi
 te were signing up for an account.\n\n* Hypothesis: While this is in line 
 with many benchmarks\, you felt that the value prop was not clear enough a
 nd by making adjustments to the website you could increase the number of w
 ebsite visitors who register for an account.\n\n* Action: You made a serie
 s of changes to the website.\n\n* Results: Website visitors who register f
 or an account changed from 1% to 2%\n\n \n\nHypothesis 2\n\n* Context: 40
 % of account registrations were for paid accounts\, 60% were for free acco
 unts. \n\n* Hypothesis: You believed you could increase the % of registra
 tions for paid accounts by accepting Apple Pay so that Apple users wouldn
 ’t have to enter credit card information.\n\n* Action: You implemented A
 pple Pay as an option.\n\n* Results: Paid registrations dropped from 40% o
 f registrations to 20%.\n\nHypothesis 3\n\n* Context: For people who regis
 tered for a free account\, 10% of them upgraded to a paid account within t
 he first 30 days. \n\n* Hypothesis: You believed that highlighting a few 
 premium features in the free version would entice upgrades.\n\n* Action: Y
 ou changed the free version to highlight features from the premium (paid) 
 version.\n\n* Results: Users who upgrade from free accounts to paid accoun
 ts within the first 30 days stayed flat at 10%.\n\n \n\nLet’s assume al

DESCRIPTION:This is a team assignment.  Only 1 (one) assignment should be
  turned in per team. \n\nRecall that Crit sessions are times where studen
 ts engage with external practitioners throughout the course. These practit
 ioners are active\, product owners\, technical managers\, founders\, and e
 ntrepreneurs in NYC who join us on select evenings during the semester to 
 provide practical feedback and instruction\, encourage progress\, and help
  address any blockers or risks the students are facing. Crit is not only a
 n opportunity for your to received guidance and feedback on your venture i
 dea and progress but also an opportunity for your to network. \n\nInstruc
 tions\n\n1. Assign at least one person to record the feedback received dur
 ing Crit. \n2. Write a 1 pager (max)\, identifying the feedback you've re
 ceived. Discuss explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the feedback
 . This means the document should clearly document the feedback given\, how
  you interpreted the feedback\, whether you agree or disagree with the fee
 dback\, and your reasons for the same. You may also discuss what you plan 
 to do with the feedback.\n3. Submit as a PDF.\n\nIllustrative Example: \n
 * Feedback: The practitioner stated that two other startups have tried a v
 ery similar idea\, but failed in execution. \n* Interpretation: The pract
 itioner is concerned that we can't execute the idea because it is technica
 lly difficult.\n* Agree/Disagree: Disagree\, because we interviewed three 
 subject matter experts during our stakeholder research and showed new prom
 ising technology where this is now possible. \n* Plan for feedback: The p
 ractitioner identified an execution risk and we intend to explore this ris
 k further.\n\nPro Tips: \n\n1. Not all practitioners will be in the indus
 try that you are working in. You need to present and talk about what you'r
 e doing in layman’s terms that are easy to understand. This is what this
  assignment is teaching you. Do not spend the full 5 minutes walking a pra
 ctitioner through the entire process. \n2. You may receive conflicting fe
 edback from different practitioners. That’s ok - it’s actually part of
  the process. That's why the focus is how you decide what to do with the f
 eedback. Remember that each piece of feedback is a single data point\, not
  gospel\, so you may occasionally choose to disregard feedback that you re
 ceive in Crit. Learning how to filter feedback is crucial to product devel
 opment and entrepreneurship. It’s only when you notice trends in feedbac
 k that ignoring them becomes an issue. Remember to Connect the Dots.

X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<p>This is a team assignment.&nbsp\; Only 1 (
 one) assignment should be turned in per team.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p>Recall that C
 rit sessions are times where students engage with external practitioners t
 hroughout the course. These practitioners are active\, product owners\, te
 chnical managers\, founders\, and entrepreneurs in NYC who join us on sele
 ct evenings during the semester to provide practical feedback and instruct
 ion\, encourage progress\, and help address any blockers or risks the stud
 ents are facing. Crit is not only an opportunity for your to received guid
 ance and feedback on your venture idea and progress but also an opportunit
 y for your to network.&nbsp\;</p>\n<p><span>Instructions</span></p>\n<p>1.
  Assign at least one person to record the feedback received during Crit.&n
 bsp\;<br>2. Write a 1 pager (max)\, identifying the feedback you've receiv
 ed. Discuss explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the feedback. Th
 is means the document should clearly document the feedback given\, how you
  interpreted the feedback\, whether you agree or disagree with the feedbac
 k\, and your reasons for the same. You may also discuss what you plan to d
 o with the feedback.<br>3. Submit as a PDF.</p>\n<p><br>Illustrative Examp
 le:&nbsp\;<br>* Feedback: The practitioner stated that two other startups 
 have tried a very similar idea\, but failed in execution.&nbsp\;<br>* Inte
 rpretation: The practitioner is concerned that we can't execute the idea b
 ecause it is technically difficult.<br>* Agree/Disagree: Disagree\, becaus
 e we interviewed three subject matter experts during our stakeholder resea
 rch and showed new promising technology where this is now possible.&nbsp\;
 <br>* Plan for feedback: The practitioner identified an execution risk and
  we intend to explore this risk further.</p>\n<p><br>Pro Tips:&nbsp\;</p>\
 n<p>1. Not all practitioners will be in the industry that you are working 
 in. You need to present and talk about what you're doing in layman’s ter
 ms that are easy to understand. This is what this assignment is teaching y
 ou. Do not spend the full 5 minutes walking a practitioner through the ent
 ire process.&nbsp\;<br>2. You may receive conflicting feedback from differ
 ent practitioners. That’s ok - it’s actually part of the process. That
 's why the focus is how you decide what to do with the feedback. Remember 
 that each piece of feedback is a single data point\, not gospel\, so you m
 ay occasionally choose to disregard feedback that you receive in Crit. Lea
 rning how to filter feedback is crucial to product development and entrepr
 eneurship. It’s only when you notice trends in feedback that ignoring th
 em becomes an issue.<span>&nbsp\;</span><strong>Remember to Connect the Do
