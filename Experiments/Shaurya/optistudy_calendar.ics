DESCRIPTION:* Watch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game for
  crypto history.\n\n* Watch the movie: Banking on Bitcoin http://www.imd
 b.com/title/tt5033790/\n\n \n\nAnswer the following questions and submit 
 the answers with your final deliverable:\n\nHW1:\n\n1) give an informal de
 finition of a private-key encryption scheme.\n\n2) Consider a sample encry
 ption scheme where the key is a random 4-digit pin code denoted by: d1\, d
 2\, d3\, d4. To encrypt a message m\, first break the message up into chun
 ks of four letters. Next\, shift each four-letter block of your message by
  your pin code. For instance\, if the key (i.e.\, the pin code) is 3412\, 
 the message GOODMORNING gets encrypted as follows:\n\n \n\n       
      G O O D      M O R  N       I   N  G\n\n      
       3  4  1  2        3  4  1  2        3 
  4   1\n\n            J   S  P  F        P  S  
  S  P       L  R  H\n\nThe following tool allows you to play aroun
 d with this "PIN-encryption" scheme: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hahbv9v6z3
 istug/PIN-encrypt.xlsx?dl=0\n\n* a) Encrypt the message ILOVECORNELLTECH u
 sing the PIN 7942\; b) explain how to decrypt messages\; c) is this encr
 yption scheme secure? (motivate your answer!)\n\n3) given an informal defi
 nition of a public-key encryption scheme.\n\n4) give an informal definitio
 n of a digital signature scheme.\n\n4) describe the difference between a p
 ublic-key and a secret-key in a digital signature scheme\n\n5) describe ho
 w we can use a "trusted ledger" (e.g. a trusted facebook wall) in combinat
 ion with digital signatures to create a crypto currency. Explain how digit
 al signatures protect money from being stolen. Discuss some pro's and con'
 s w.r.t. standard banking.  \n\nHW2:\n\n1) Explain the difference between
  a proof-of-work blockchain\, a proof-of-stake blockchain\, and a permissi
 oned blockchain. Discuss some advantages and disadvantages w.r.t. each of 
 them.\n\n2) Give one example of a situation where you would prefer to use 
 a permissioned blockchain\, and one where you would prefer to use a permis
 sionless (i.e.\, a proof-of-work or proof-or-stake based one).\n\n3) Mine 
 10 ``blocks'' in excel:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lvmqog3m0wmioq8/minin
 g-in-excel.xlsx?dl=0\n\n4) Informally describe the liveness and consistenc
 y properties that a blockchain should satisfy.\n\n5) Consider a candidate 
 blockchain protocol—let’s call it CornellChain—where a list of trans
 actions is replicated among 100 different servers. If someone wanted to ad
 d a transaction to this blockchain\, they would simply send it to one (or 
 more) of the servers together with the time that the transaction was made.
  Any server that receives a new transaction also sends it to all other ser
 vers. Transactions on this blockchain are ordered on each server according
  to the time when they were made.\n\n \n\nDoes CornellChain satisfy liven
 ess and/or consistency under some assumptions on the fraction of correct s
 ervers. Can you think of a scenario under which consistency can be broken?
  Are there situations where CornellChain can still function as a valid “
 blockchain”?\n\n \n\nProject Deliverable\n\nPick some recent cryptocurr
 ency/ICO or blockchain application\; write an approx 5-7 page report (in t
 ext\, not powerpoint) analyzing it. Think of the intended audience of the 
 report as a VC who is considering investing in the currency. Explain advan
 tages/disadvantages of the cryptocurrency w.r.t. e.g.\, Bitcoin. Explain w
 hether the blockchain employed is permissioned or permissionless (and in t
 his case\, whether it relies on proof of work or proof of stake). Does it 
 support smart contracts? Does the currency have any special new applicatio
 ns or use cases? \n\nOther final projects options are also available such
  as e.g.\,\n\n* developing a financial model for evaluating worth of a cry
 ptocurrency.\n\n* studying some blockchain application from a societal poi
 nt of view. \n\nYour groups should also prepare a 15 min presentation to 
 be jointly presented in class. \n\n--------------------------------------
 ---------------------------\n\nPlease submit the whole final deliverable i
 n one pdf which includes a) the answer to all HW problems\, and b) the fin
 al report + slides for your presentaion. You should only submit 1 pdf fil
 e per group of 4-5 people\, and clearly mark all the participants of the g
 roup. The final deliverable is due on March 21st.
