DESCRIPTION:To complete this assignment\, you must give each teammate 2 pi
 eces of advice on Grow in Slack and review the feedback you received from 
 your teammates.\n\nThis assignment is an individual assignment and is due 
 on March 28th at 12pm. Simply confirm by entering the text "Completed" be
 low once you're done with these steps. (We will have access to the data ab
 out who has submitted through Grow\, so please be honest about your comple
 tion.) \n\n \n\n[Watch intro video from Startup Award winner and co-foun

 , request\, and receive feedback effectively is a professional and life sk
 ill that we want you to hone while you’re in the Studio at Cornell Tech.
  At the end of the semester you will have the opportunity to formally “r
 eview” each of your teammates as part of the peer review portion of your
  grade. However\, both positive and constructive feedback should never com
 e as a surprise in a formal review. When a teammate or employee has someth
 ing they need to improve\, they should not hear it for the first time when
  the stakes are high. By the same token\, we should never miss an opportun
 ity to praise our teammates in real time!\n\n \n\nNow that we’re halfwa
 y through the semester\, it’s a good time to reflect on how your team is
  doing and how you relate to your teammates.\n\n \n\n1. Using Grow\, each
  member of the team is required to provide two pieces of actionable feedba
 ck to each member of their team. You should use the “Give Feedback” fu
 nction two separate times for each teammate so we can verify that you deli
 vered two pieces of feedback. It’s important that you take the time to d
 eliver this feedback in a way that helps each of your teammates grow as pr
 ofessionals\, so we expect that you’ll put some thought into what you wi
 ll say. To give high-quality feedback\, use the templates in Grow\, the re
 sources we provide below\, as well as your previous feedback conversations
  in Grow! If you would like additional help or guidance on giving feedback
 \, feel free to reach out to Leandra or the Grow team!\n\n \n\n2. After t
 he feedback has been given/received\, we encourage each team member to rea
 d through the feedback they received and reflect on how they will improve 
 as a team member. While there is no formal requirement to write a reflecti
 on about the feedback received\, each member should think critically about
  how they will act on it. This will come into play at the end of the semes
 ter when we ask for formal peer feedback - whether or not the previously r
 eceived feedback remained an issue for your teammates. \n\n \n\n**Please
  note: The Studio team will not have access to the content of your mid-sem
 ester feedback but we will be tracking whether or not you completed the as
 signment.\n\n \n\nThere are many resources (sometimes conflicting) that p
 rovide direction on how to give and receive feedback. There is no one righ
 t way to do it (though there are many WRONG ways). Here are our tips:\n\n1
 . Stick to concrete observations of behavioral patterns rather than making
  generalizations or harping on isolated events\n\n* Effective: In our team
  meeting last week you interrupted me several times while we were discussi
 ng our plan for Sprint 2. I have observed this in a few of our recent meet
 ings.\n\n* Not effective: You interrupt people a lot in meetings.\n\n2. Te
 ll your teammate how this behavior impacts you specifically\n\n* Effective
 :  In our team meeting last week you interrupted me several times while w
 e were discussing our plan for Sprint 2. I have observed this in a few of 
 our recent meetings. I am a bit more timid than the rest of the team so wh
 en I am interrupted I feel shut down and am less likely to contribute in t
 he future.\n\n* Not Effective: You interrupt people a lot in meetings. Now
  people on the team don’t want to participate.\n\n3. Describe what you w
 ould like to see in the future\n\n* Effective:  In our team meeting last 
 week you interrupted me several times while we were discussing our plan fo
 r Sprint 2. I have observed this in a few of our recent meetings. I am a b
 it more timid than the rest of the team so when I am interrupted I feel sh
 ut down and am less likely to contribute in the future. Moving forward\, I
  would really appreciate it if you would make an effort to let me finish m
 y thoughts before you jump in. \n\n* Not Effective: You interrupt people 
 a lot in meetings. Now people on the team don’t want to participate. Mee
 tings with you are impossible. \n\n4. Remember that you are not providing
  any value judgments about your teammates and should avoid language that i
 nterprets a teammate's motivations or behaviors.\n\n* ASSUME POSITIVE INTE

DESCRIPTION:--------\nScenario\n--------\n\nYou built a Minimum Viable Pro
 duct for a virtual assistant\, which helps working professionals better ma
 nage their calendar by providing recommendations about work\, social\, and
  family activities. You launched it and your user base is growing. After s
 eeing initial results\, you developed a few hypotheses and prioritized fea
 tures on the roadmap accordingly.\n\n \n\nBelow is a summary of your 3 ke
 y hypotheses\, the actions you took based on your hypotheses\, and the res
 ults.\n\n \n\nHypothesis 1\n\n* Context: 1% of users who visit your websi
 te were signing up for an account.\n\n* Hypothesis: While this is in line 
 with many benchmarks\, you felt that the value prop was not clear enough a
 nd by making adjustments to the website you could increase the number of w
 ebsite visitors who register for an account.\n\n* Action: You made a serie
 s of changes to the website.\n\n* Results: Website visitors who register f
 or an account changed from 1% to 2%\n\n \n\nHypothesis 2\n\n* Context: 40
 % of account registrations were for paid accounts\, 60% were for free acco
 unts. \n\n* Hypothesis: You believed you could increase the % of registra
 tions for paid accounts by accepting Apple Pay so that Apple users wouldn
 ’t have to enter credit card information.\n\n* Action: You implemented A
 pple Pay as an option.\n\n* Results: Paid registrations dropped from 40% o
 f registrations to 20%.\n\nHypothesis 3\n\n* Context: For people who regis
 tered for a free account\, 10% of them upgraded to a paid account within t
 he first 30 days. \n\n* Hypothesis: You believed that highlighting a few 
 premium features in the free version would entice upgrades.\n\n* Action: Y

DESCRIPTION:This is a team assignment.  Only 1 (one) assignment should be
  turned in per team. \n\nRecall that Crit sessions are times where studen
 ts engage with external practitioners throughout the course. These practit
 ioners are active\, product owners\, technical managers\, founders\, and e
 ntrepreneurs in NYC who join us on select evenings during the semester to 
 provide practical feedback and instruction\, encourage progress\, and help
  address any blockers or risks the students are facing. Crit is not only a
 n opportunity for your to received guidance and feedback on your venture i
 dea and progress but also an opportunity for your to network. \n\nInstruc
 tions\n\n1. Assign at least one person to record the feedback received dur
 ing Crit. \n2. Write a 1 pager (max)\, identifying the feedback you've re
 ceived. Discuss explicitly whether you agree or disagree with the feedback
 . This means the document should clearly document the feedback given\, how
  you interpreted the feedback\, whether you agree or disagree with the fee
 dback\, and your reasons for the same. You may also discuss what you plan 
 to do with the feedback.\n3. Submit as a PDF.\n\nIllustrative Example: \n
 * Feedback: The practitioner stated that two other startups have tried a v
 ery similar idea\, but failed in execution. \n* Interpretation: The pract
 itioner is concerned that we can't execute the idea because it is technica
 lly difficult.\n* Agree/Disagree: Disagree\, because we interviewed three 
 subject matter experts during our stakeholder research and showed new prom
 ising technology where this is now possible. \n* Plan for feedback: The p
 ractitioner identified an execution risk and we intend to explore this ris
 k further.\n\nPro Tips: \n\n1. Not all practitioners will be in the indus
 try that you are working in. You need to present and talk about what you'r
 e doing in layman’s terms that are easy to understand. This is what this
  assignment is teaching you. Do not spend the full 5 minutes walking a pra
 ctitioner through the entire process. \n2. You may receive conflicting fe
 edback from different practitioners. That’s ok - it’s actually part of
  the process. That's why the focus is how you decide what to do with the f
 eedback. Remember that each piece of feedback is a single data point\, not
  gospel\, so you may occasionally choose to disregard feedback that you re
 ceive in Crit. Learning how to filter feedback is crucial to product devel
 opment and entrepreneurship. It’s only when you notice trends in feedbac
 k that ignoring them becomes an issue. Remember to Connect the Dots.
