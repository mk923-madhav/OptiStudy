DESCRIPTION:The final deliverable for this course is a business case or a 
 business plan. You can either write a short case on an existing entreprene
 urial firm in a creative industry\, or submit a business plan for your ven
 ture.\n\nThe paper should be 2000-2500 words long.\n\n OBJECTIVE OF THIS 
 DELIVERABLE\n\n How should entrepreneurs and firms in creative/cultural i
 ndustries think about navigating the complex structures to make the most o
 f new opportunities generated by changes such as digitalization and global
 ization? The paper will enable you to examine these issues in the context
  of a planned\, existing\, or departed firm and to apply course concepts 
 in order to provide analysis and a plan of action.\n\nTOPICS\n\n Like Hen
 ry Ford’s cars\, you can pick any topic\, as long as it pertains to firm
 s in the context of creative/cultural industries. If you want to write abo
 ut a creator – the individual artist or filmmaker\, or designer\, or mus
 ician\, etc. – the paper should still connect the individual to a firm o
 r market (for instance\, you may want to analyze how an author’s publish
 er may or may not have affected the author’s career).\n\n* You can write
  about a startup or an incumbent\, a for-profit or non-profit. You can ana
 lyze success or If you are thinkingabout starting your own venture\, you c
 an write a mini strategy document for the venture\, that covers topics and
  concepts from thecourse.\n\n* You can also write about other topics that 
 are pertinent to firms in these industries\, taking the perspective of an 
 entrepreneur or incumbent to discuss how firms can deal with major shifts 
 such as:\n\n* The digitized production\, consumption\, and distribution of
  cultural products and what that means for firms/markets\n\n* Other techno
 logical shifts and their impact and implications on firms/markets\n\n* Ide
 ological/cultural shifts and their impact and implications on firms/market
 s\n\nDon’t feel obliged to limit yourself to these topics. We can discus
 s your proposal to ensure it will be something from which you will learn.\
 n\nCONTENT AND STRUCTURE OF THE PAPER\n\n Think of it as a case\, with th
 e “solution” or “action plan” included. Introduce the firm and/or 
 the issue. Provide a description ofthe context and the situation or proble
 m. Provide analysis\, using the course concepts. Suggest a course of actio
 n\; if you are writing about a failure\, discuss what could have prevented
  failure. You can\, of course\, write a “field” case or use primary da
 ta\, but using already published\, secondary materials is also perfectly a
 cceptable. In the latter situation\, do bring in examples and evidence\, 
 whenever possible. If you choose to disguise the firm\, please clarify tha
 t you have done so. If you conduct primary research and the company provid
 es you with confidential information\, please flag it\, so I can treat it 
 accordingly.\n\nSUBMISSION AND WRITING GUIDELINES\n\n* This is an individu
 al submission\n\n* The paper is due: March 19\, 2022\n\n* Submission: Plea
 se submit a Word or Pdf file. The case should include your netid in the he
 ader and theword count somewhere in the The filename should be ECI2022_Fin
 al_YourNetid.\n\n* The paper should be 2000-2500 words\, and I will penali
 ze essays longer than 2625 words (2% for every additional word upto 100).\
 n\n* A 10% penalty shall be incurred for every day of late\n\n* The essay 
 accounts for 60% of your grade. If you prefer\, I can permit you to write 
 two short papers for 30% each\, upon\n\n* Usual criteria of good writing a
 pply. To repeat what all writers are told – please write something you k
 now\, believe in\, andfeel strongly That will yield the best outcome. Do r
 emember that the course has no “party line.” Feel free todisagree (wit
 h the assigned articles or cases\, some things said in our class discussio
 ns\, things I have said). Keep the following in mind as you write the case
 :\n\n* A well-defined structure – along the lines of\, ‘Introduction\,
  Evidence and Analysis\, Implications and Conclusion’ – willhelp you w
 rite\, while allowing the reader to follow your line of\n\n* The introduct

  crypto history.\n\n* Watch the movie: Banking on Bitcoin http://www.imd
 b.com/title/tt5033790/\n\n \n\nAnswer the following questions and submit 
 the answers with your final deliverable:\n\nHW1:\n\n1) give an informal de
 finition of a private-key encryption scheme.\n\n2) Consider a sample encry
 ption scheme where the key is a random 4-digit pin code denoted by: d1\, d
 2\, d3\, d4. To encrypt a message m\, first break the message up into chun
 ks of four letters. Next\, shift each four-letter block of your message by
  your pin code. For instance\, if the key (i.e.\, the pin code) is 3412\, 
 the message GOODMORNING gets encrypted as follows:\n\n \n\n       
      G O O D      M O R  N       I   N  G\n\n

 sing the PIN 7942\; b) explain how to decrypt messages\; c) is this encr
 yption scheme secure? (motivate your answer!)\n\n3) given an informal defi
 nition of a public-key encryption scheme.\n\n4) give an informal definitio
 n of a digital signature scheme.\n\n4) describe the difference between a p
 ublic-key and a secret-key in a digital signature scheme\n\n5) describe ho
 w we can use a "trusted ledger" (e.g. a trusted facebook wall) in combinat
 ion with digital signatures to create a crypto currency. Explain how digit
 al signatures protect money from being stolen. Discuss some pro's and con'
 s w.r.t. standard banking.  \n\nHW2:\n\n1) Explain the difference between
  a proof-of-work blockchain\, a proof-of-stake blockchain\, and a permissi
 oned blockchain. Discuss some advantages and disadvantages w.r.t. each of 
 them.\n\n2) Give one example of a situation where you would prefer to use 
 a permissioned blockchain\, and one where you would prefer to use a permis
 sionless (i.e.\, a proof-of-work or proof-or-stake based one).\n\n3) Mine 
 10 ``blocks'' in excel:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/lvmqog3m0wmioq8/minin
 g-in-excel.xlsx?dl=0\n\n4) Informally describe the liveness and consistenc
 y properties that a blockchain should satisfy.\n\n5) Consider a candidate 
 blockchain protocol—let’s call it CornellChain—where a list of trans
 actions is replicated among 100 different servers. If someone wanted to ad
 d a transaction to this blockchain\, they would simply send it to one (or 
 more) of the servers together with the time that the transaction was made.
  Any server that receives a new transaction also sends it to all other ser
 vers. Transactions on this blockchain are ordered on each server according
  to the time when they were made.\n\n \n\nDoes CornellChain satisfy liven
 ess and/or consistency under some assumptions on the fraction of correct s
 ervers. Can you think of a scenario under which consistency can be broken?
  Are there situations where CornellChain can still function as a valid “
 blockchain”?\n\n \n\nProject Deliverable\n\nPick some recent cryptocurr
 ency/ICO or blockchain application\; write an approx 5-7 page report (in t
 ext\, not powerpoint) analyzing it. Think of the intended audience of the 
 report as a VC who is considering investing in the currency. Explain advan
 tages/disadvantages of the cryptocurrency w.r.t. e.g.\, Bitcoin. Explain w
 hether the blockchain employed is permissioned or permissionless (and in t
 his case\, whether it relies on proof of work or proof of stake). Does it 
 support smart contracts? Does the currency have any special new applicatio
 ns or use cases? \n\nOther final projects options are also available such
  as e.g.\,\n\n* developing a financial model for evaluating worth of a cry
 ptocurrency.\n\n* studying some blockchain application from a societal poi
 nt of view. \n\nYour groups should also prepare a 15 min presentation to 
 be jointly presented in class. \n\n--------------------------------------

 n one pdf which includes a) the answer to all HW problems\, and b) the fin
 al report + slides for your presentaion. You should only submit 1 pdf fil
 e per group of 4-5 people\, and clearly mark all the participants of the g
 roup. The final deliverable is due on March 21st.

DESCRIPTION:It is good practice to summarize the outcome of meetings by sh
 aring the takeaways and action items with everyone who took the time to at
 tend the meeting.\n\nEach time you check in with your Company Advisor\, as
 sign a member of your team to take careful notes. After the meeting\, summ
 arize those notes\, with takeaways and action items\, and send them to you
 r Company Advisor and everyone on the team. This is an opportunity for you
  to ensure that everyone is on the same page\, and gives the advisors a ch
 ance to ask questions or add additional context.\n\nIn addition\, the Stud
 io team would like to get ongoing feedback from the Company Advisor about 
 their experiences with the Studio program\, so that we can make sure futur
 e classes can continue to have positive experiences with Companies. So in
 clude in your email the following line. (It's fine to copy-and-paste this.
 )\n\nCornell Tech welcomes your feedback about BigCo Studio. We would appr
 eciate it if you could take a moment to fill out this quick survey about h

  took the time to attend the meeting.</p>\n<p>Each time you check in with 
 your Company Advisor\, assign a member of your team to take careful notes.
  After the meeting\, summarize those notes\, with takeaways and action ite
 ms\, and send them to your Company Advisor and everyone on the team. This 
 is an opportunity for you to ensure that everyone is on the same page\, an
 d gives the advisors a chance to ask questions or add additional context.<

DESCRIPTION:Starting with your in-class draft as a starting point\, spend 
 some time refining your North Star Metric. Think carefully about what your
  "game" is (Attention\, Transaction\, Productivity) or\, if your Job To Be
  Done is well-defined\, how you might link your NSM to your JTBD. (If that
  doesn't feel right\, it's a sign that your JTBD needs work!)\n\nThen\, us
 ing the dimensions discussed in class (breadth\, depth\, frequency\, effic
 iency)\, identify three "input metrics" that would\, when combined\, lead 
 to meaningful improvements in your overall NSM.\n\nIn your team's submissi
 on\, include:\n\n* Your team name\n\n* Your product narrative (theory of c
 hange\, elevator pitch\, job to be done\, etc.)\n\n* Your North Star Metri
 c\n\n* Your three input metrics\n\nBelow are reference readings about Nort
 h Star Metrics that can help you in this exercise:\n\n* [North Star Playbo
 ok] (https://amplitude.com/north-star)\n\n* [LinkedIn case study] (http://
